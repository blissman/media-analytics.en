# Event types and descriptions{#event-types-and-descriptions}

## sessionStart

Sent with the `sessions` call. When the response returns, you extract the Session ID from the Location header and use it for subsequent event calls to the Collection server.

## play

Sent when the player changes state to "playing" from another state (i.e., the `on('Playing')` callback is triggered by the player). Other states from which the player moves to "playing" include "buffering", the user resumed from "paused", the player recovered from an error, autoplay, and so on. 

## ping

* **Main Content -** Must be sent every 10 seconds during main content playback, regardless of other API events that have been sent. The first ping event should fire 10 seconds after main content playback has begun. 
* **Ad Content -** Must be sent every 1 second during ad tracking.

Ping events should *not* include the `params` map in the request body.

## bitrateChange

Sent when the bitrage changes.

## bufferStart

Sent when buffering starts. There is no `bufferResume` event type. A `bufferResume` is inferred when you send a `play` event after `bufferStart`.

## pauseStart

Sent when the user presses Pause. There is no `resume` event type. A `resume` is inferred when you send a `play` event after a `pauseStart`.

## adBreakStart

Signals the start of an ad break 

## adStart

Signals the start of an ad 

## adComplete

Signals the completion of an ad

## adSkip

Signals an ad skip

## adBreakComplete

Signals the completion of an ad break

## chapterStart

Signals the start of a chapter segment

## chapterSkip

Signals a chapter skip

## chapterComplete

Signals the completion of a chapter

## error

Signals an error occurred.

## sessionEnd

This is used to notify the Media Analytics backend to immediately close the session when the user has abandoned their viewing of the content and they are unlikely to return.

If you don't send a `sessionEnd`, an abandoned session will time-out normally (after no events are received for 10 minutes, or when no playhead movement occurs for 30 minutes), and the session is deleted by the backend.

## sessionComplete

Sent when the end of the main content is reached
